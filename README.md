- Hey, Matthew here! Rolling with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript, obviously for frontend development. Learning Vue and React!
- Interested in programming, games, rock climbing, gardening, orchids, RPGs, art, and baking, AKA, a little bit of everything.
- I'm open to helping with frontend projects or documenation. If I can understand it, I can probably explain it!
- I'll be posting some personal projects from time to time here.
